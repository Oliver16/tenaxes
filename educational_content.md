# Educational Content for TenAxes Questions

## C1: Economic Control (State-Directed ↔ Market-Directed)

**Q1:** Private enterprise generally delivers goods and services more efficiently than government agencies.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether competition and profit incentives lead to better outcomes than public administration. Consider examples like postal services vs. private couriers, or public vs. private healthcare systems.

**Q2:** Prices for essential goods should be determined by supply and demand, not government regulation.
- *Educational Content:* This contrasts market pricing (where scarcity raises prices) with price controls (government-set limits). Examples include rent control, agricultural price supports, or pharmaceutical pricing regulations.

**Q3:** Governments should allow failing businesses to collapse rather than intervene with bailouts.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether market discipline (business failure) is preferable to government intervention during economic crises. Think of bank bailouts in 2008 or airline industry support during COVID-19.

**Q4:** Competition between private companies benefits consumers more than public alternatives would.
- *Educational Content:* This weighs competitive markets against public monopolies. Consider whether multiple private insurers serve citizens better than a single public option, or whether competing transit companies improve service.

**Q5:** Governments should set price controls on necessities like housing, food, and medicine.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether market forces should determine costs of essentials, or if government should cap prices to ensure affordability. Examples include rent control, insulin price caps, or bread subsidies.

**Q6:** The state should directly control strategic industries like energy, transportation, and banking.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses nationalization versus privatization of critical sectors. Consider whether vital infrastructure functions better under public ownership (like Norway's oil) or private management.

**Q7:** Central planning can distribute resources more fairly than markets do.
- *Educational Content:* This contrasts deliberate allocation by planners with market-driven distribution. Think of Soviet-style planned economies versus market economies, or centralized healthcare allocation versus insurance markets.

**Q8:** Essential services (water, electricity, internet) should be publicly owned and operated.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether utilities should be public goods or private businesses. Consider municipal water systems versus private water companies, or public broadband versus commercial ISPs.

## C2: Economic Equality (Redistributionist ↔ Property Rights)

**Q9:** Narrowing the gap between rich and poor should be a central goal of economic policy.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether reducing inequality itself is a priority, separate from reducing poverty. A society could lift the poor while the rich grow richer, or it could focus on closing the gap itself.

**Q10:** A universal basic income, funded by taxing wealth, would create a more just society.
- *Educational Content:* UBI provides regular cash payments to all citizens regardless of work status. This asks whether redistributing wealth this way improves fairness compared to conditional welfare or keeping wealth with earners.

**Q11:** Large concentrations of private wealth are corrosive to democracy and social cohesion.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether extreme wealth accumulation poses political and social dangers beyond economic questions. Consider influence over media, politics, and whether billionaires distort democratic processes.

**Q12:** Society has an obligation to ensure that no one falls below a decent standard of living.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether meeting basic needs is a collective responsibility or individual one. It's about floors (minimum standards) rather than ceilings or gaps.

**Q13:** People have a fundamental right to keep what they earn, regardless of how much others have.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes individual property rights over redistribution. It suggests earnings belong to earners by right, not subject to social allocation based on others' needs.

**Q14:** Inheritance taxes unfairly prevent families from passing on what they have built.
- *Educational Content:* Estate or inheritance taxes take a portion of wealth transfers between generations. This asks whether taxing inheritance is legitimate redistribution or unjust confiscation of already-taxed assets.

**Q15:** High taxes on top earners discourage the productive effort that benefits everyone.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether progressive taxation reduces incentives to work, invest, or innovate. It weighs revenue for public services against potential economic dampening from high marginal rates.

**Q16:** Wealth inequality is a natural outcome of differences in talent, effort, and choices.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests unequal outcomes reflect unequal inputs (ability, hard work, decisions) rather than systemic unfairness. It frames inequality as meritocratic rather than structural.

## C3: Coercive Power (Security/Order ↔ Civil Liberties)

**Q17:** Protecting individual privacy is more important than making law enforcement's job easier.
- *Educational Content:* This weighs the security-privacy tradeoff: should police have broad surveillance powers, or should privacy protections limit investigative tools? Think encrypted phones, warrantless searches, or mass data collection.

**Q18:** People should be free to express offensive views without legal penalty.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses free speech boundaries: should government prosecute hate speech, misinformation, or offensive expression? It contrasts legal tolerance of harmful speech with restrictions protecting groups.

**Q19:** Citizens should have access to strong encryption without government back-doors.
- *Educational Content:* Encryption protects data from everyone, including police. Back-doors allow government access but create security vulnerabilities. This asks whether absolute privacy or lawful access should prevail.

**Q20:** The right to protest, even disruptively, is essential to a free society.
- *Educational Content:* This balances protest rights against public order. Should demonstrations blocking traffic or commerce be protected expression, or should law enforcement clear disruptive actions quickly?

**Q21:** Strict law enforcement and visible policing are necessary to maintain public safety.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether strong police presence and aggressive enforcement deter crime and create safety, or whether they create tension without improving security.

**Q22:** Governments should be able to detain terrorism suspects without trial when security demands it.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses indefinite detention, secret evidence, or suspension of habeas corpus during emergencies. It weighs immediate security threats against due process protections.

**Q23:** Some speech is so harmful that it should be legally prohibited.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether certain expression (incitement, hate speech, misinformation) warrants criminal penalties, or whether nearly all speech should remain legal despite potential harm.

**Q24:** Schools and employers should enforce conduct codes even when they limit personal expression.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses institutional authority over speech and behavior. Should organizations regulate employee or student expression beyond legal minimums, or should individual liberty take priority?

## C4: Where Power Sits (Centralized ↔ Localized)

**Q25:** Local communities should have the final word on matters like zoning, schooling, and policing.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether neighborhood or city control produces better outcomes than state or national mandates. Think local school boards versus federal education standards, or municipal police control versus national oversight.

**Q26:** States or provinces should be able to pass laws that differ from national policy.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses federalism: should regional governments have wide autonomy, or should national uniformity prevail? Consider state cannabis laws conflicting with federal prohibition, or regional immigration policies.

**Q27:** Decisions made closest to the people affected tend to produce better outcomes.
- *Educational Content:* This principle ("subsidiarity") suggests local decision-makers understand local needs better than distant officials. It contrasts decentralized responsiveness with centralized consistency.

**Q28:** Regions should be allowed to experiment with different policies rather than follow a single national model.
- *Educational Content:* This frames regional autonomy as "laboratories of democracy" where diverse approaches compete. It weighs innovation and choice against uniform standards and coordination.

**Q29:** National standards are necessary to guarantee equal rights and services everywhere.
- *Educational Content:* This argues centralization prevents local tyranny or inequality. Federal civil rights protections, for instance, override local discrimination; national healthcare standards ensure minimum quality.

**Q30:** Only a strong central government can coordinate responses to large-scale challenges.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses problems requiring unified action: pandemics, climate change, economic crises. It asks whether national coordination is essential or whether decentralized responses work better.

**Q31:** Too much local autonomy leads to fragmentation and unequal treatment across regions.
- *Educational Content:* This warns that decentralization creates patchwork systems where rights and services vary by location, producing unfairness and inefficiency from lack of coordination.

**Q32:** Some issues are too important to leave to local jurisdictions with varying capacities.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests certain matters (human rights, major infrastructure, defense) exceed local capability or authority and require national or international handling.

## C5: Cultural Orientation (Traditionalist ↔ Progressivist)

**Q33:** Cultural norms should evolve to reflect new understandings of identity and relationships.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether social norms about gender, family, sexuality, etc., should change with emerging knowledge and values, or whether traditional frameworks should endure.

**Q34:** Society benefits when people question inherited customs and experiment with new ways of living.
- *Educational Content:* This weighs cultural innovation and individual exploration against stability from established practices. It asks whether questioning tradition strengthens or weakens communities.

**Q35:** Traditional expectations about gender and family are outdated constraints that should be discarded.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether conventional gender roles, marriage models, and family structures reflect timeless wisdom or historical limitations that modern society should move beyond.

**Q36:** Moral progress often requires abandoning practices that previous generations considered normal.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests moral improvement involves rejecting past norms (slavery, patriarchy, etc.). It asks whether modernity represents advancement or whether tradition holds enduring value.

**Q37:** Longstanding traditions carry wisdom that modern generations too easily dismiss.
- *Educational Content:* This argues customs endure because they encode accumulated knowledge and social capital. Rapid change may discard valuable insights embedded in tradition.

**Q38:** Stable families built on time-tested structures are the foundation of a healthy society.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes traditional family models (typically two-parent, marriage-based) as essential social infrastructure. It suggests deviation weakens community stability.

**Q39:** Rapid cultural change destabilizes communities and erodes the values that bind people together.
- *Educational Content:* This warns that swift shifts in norms fragment shared identity and undermine social cohesion. Gradual evolution may preserve continuity better than revolutionary cultural change.

**Q40:** There is value in preserving customs and rituals even when their original purpose has faded.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests traditions provide meaning, identity, and continuity independent of their practical origins. Rituals may matter for what they symbolize rather than what they originally accomplished.

## C6: Group Boundaries (Particularist ↔ Universalist)

**Q41:** People naturally and rightly owe more loyalty to their own community than to outsiders.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether prioritizing family, neighbors, or co-nationals is morally legitimate or whether equal concern for all humans is required. Think preferring local hiring or "taking care of our own."

**Q42:** A society that does not put its own members first will eventually be unable to help anyone.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests resource limits require prioritizing in-group needs. Helping outsiders extensively may deplete capacity to maintain domestic welfare, ultimately harming everyone.

**Q43:** It is reasonable to prioritize people who share your culture or heritage in hiring and assistance.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether favoring cultural in-groups (ethnic nepotism, community preference) is justified, or whether merit and need should ignore group membership.

**Q44:** Strong group identity and mutual obligation within communities produce better outcomes than abstract universalism.
- *Educational Content:* This argues tight-knit groups with shared identity create trust and cooperation that impersonal universal principles cannot match. Think close communities versus cosmopolitan individualism.

**Q45:** Our obligations to strangers across the world are just as strong as those to our neighbors.
- *Educational Content:* This cosmopolitan view holds geographic or cultural distance doesn't reduce moral duties. A stranger's suffering in another country matters as much as a nearby neighbor's.

**Q46:** Moral rules should apply equally to all people regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion.
- *Educational Content:* This universalist principle says ethical standards don't vary by group membership. Rights, duties, and treatment should be identical for everyone, without in-group preference.

**Q47:** Aid and assistance should be allocated based on need, not on shared identity or proximity.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes objective need over relationship in distributing help. The most suffering person should receive aid first, whether they're a neighbor, fellow citizen, or distant stranger.

**Q48:** National borders are morally arbitrary lines that shouldn't determine who deserves our concern.
- *Educational Content:* This views borders as accidents of history without moral significance. Being born in a particular country doesn't make someone more deserving of resources or concern than someone born elsewhere.

## C7: Sovereignty Scope (Sovereigntist ↔ Integrationist)

**Q49:** A nation must control its own borders and immigration without outside interference.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether immigration policy is a sovereign national right or subject to international norms. Should countries freely restrict entry, or do global rules limit that power?

**Q50:** Trade agreements that constrain domestic policy undermine democratic self-determination.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether trade deals requiring regulatory changes (labor laws, environmental rules) illegitimately limit national autonomy, or whether mutual commitments justly bind participants.

**Q51:** Supranational bodies like the UN, EU, or WTO have accumulated too much power over national affairs.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether international organizations exceed their mandate and overly constrain member states, or whether their authority remains appropriate and voluntary.

**Q52:** Citizens of a country, not international bodies, should decide the laws that govern them.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes national democratic control over international authority. It asks whether domestic sovereignty should supersede global governance commitments.

**Q53:** International courts should be able to override national laws that violate human rights.
- *Educational Content:* This weighs global human rights enforcement against national sovereignty. Should international tribunals strike down domestic laws, or should nations remain final arbiters?

**Q54:** Nations should transfer some sovereignty to global institutions to address climate change.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether solving planetary problems requires binding international authority that nations cannot veto. Climate agreements might mandate emissions cuts or carbon taxes regardless of national preferences.

**Q55:** Free movement of people across borders ultimately benefits both migrants and host countries.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses open borders or migration liberalization: does reducing restrictions create mutual gains through labor mobility and cultural exchange, or does it harm receiving nations?

**Q56:** Global problems require global governance that nations cannot opt out of.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests issues like pandemics, nuclear proliferation, or climate demand mandatory international coordination. National sovereignty may need to yield to enforceable global rules.

## C8: Technology Stance (Tech-Skeptical ↔ Tech-Solutionist)

**Q57:** Technology tends to create new problems as fast as it solves existing ones.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether innovation truly improves life or merely shifts problems. Cars solved transportation but created pollution; social media connected people but fostered misinformation.

**Q58:** Society has become dangerously dependent on complex systems that few people understand.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses technological fragility: critical infrastructure (power grids, internet, supply chains) relies on opaque systems. Failures or attacks could cause cascading collapse.

**Q59:** Some technologies—certain weapons, surveillance tools, AI systems—should never have been built.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests certain innovations are inherently harmful regardless of use. Nuclear weapons, autonomous lethal drones, or advanced surveillance might cause more harm than any benefit justifies.

**Q60:** The unintended consequences of new technologies are often worse than the problems they address.
- *Educational Content:* This warns that unforeseen side effects of innovation frequently outweigh intended benefits. Pesticides solved crop loss but created environmental crises; antibiotics saved lives but bred resistant bacteria.

**Q61:** Automation and AI will create more prosperity than they destroy over time.
- *Educational Content:* This optimistic view holds that while technology displaces jobs, it generates new opportunities and wealth. Historical industrialization raised living standards despite initial disruption.

**Q62:** New technologies should generally be deployed quickly; we can address problems as they arise.
- *Educational Content:* This "move fast" approach prioritizes innovation speed over precaution. It assumes adaptive problem-solving beats preventive restriction, and that benefits outweigh risks.

**Q63:** Most major problems—health, poverty, climate—can be solved primarily through technological innovation.
- *Educational Content:* This tech-solutionist view holds that engineering and science, not social or political change, will overcome humanity's greatest challenges. Think vaccines over behavioral change, or geoengineering over emissions reduction.

**Q64:** Genetic engineering of crops and humans should be embraced as a tool for improving life.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether biotechnology (GMOs, gene therapy, designer babies) should be welcomed as progress or restricted as dangerous. It weighs benefits like disease resistance against risks and ethical concerns.

## C9: Nature's Moral Weight (Anthropocentric ↔ Ecocentric)

**Q65:** Humans have a duty to preserve wild nature even at significant cost to our own prosperity.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether environmental protection is a moral obligation worth economic sacrifice. Should we forgo development, jobs, or growth to protect ecosystems?

**Q66:** The natural world exists as a resource for human use and flourishing.
- *Educational Content:* This anthropocentric view sees nature primarily as raw material for human purposes. Trees are lumber, rivers are power sources, and animals are food or tools.

**Q67:** Ecosystems and species have intrinsic value that does not depend on their usefulness to humans.
- *Educational Content:* This ecocentric view holds that non-human life and environments matter morally independent of human benefit. A species has worth even if extinction wouldn't harm people.

**Q68:** Economic development should be constrained when it threatens biodiversity or ecosystem health.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes ecological preservation over growth. Should logging bans, fishing limits, or development restrictions protect nature even at economic cost?

**Q69:** Future generations and non-human life deserve moral consideration equal to living humans.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether people not yet born, or non-human beings, have claims on current resources and decisions equal to present humans. It extends moral concern across time and species.

**Q70:** Nature's primary value lies in the resources and services it provides to human beings.
- *Educational Content:* This instrumental view values nature for what it does for us: clean water, breathable air, food, medicine. Protection is justified by human benefit, not nature's own worth.

**Q71:** When human well-being and environmental preservation conflict, human needs should come first.
- *Educational Content:* This prioritizes human welfare over ecological concerns when tradeoffs arise. If protecting a wetland costs jobs or housing, human needs win.

**Q72:** Protecting endangered species is not worth major economic sacrifice.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether species preservation justifies significant costs. Should we spend billions to save a beetle or obscure fish if it means job losses or restricted development?

## C10: Moral Foundation (Moral Universalist ↔ Moral Pluralist)

**Q73:** What counts as right and wrong depends largely on cultural context and historical circumstances.
- *Educational Content:* This moral relativist view holds ethics vary by society and era. Practices acceptable in one culture or time may be wrong in another; morality is context-dependent.

**Q74:** Some actions are objectively wrong regardless of what any culture or individual believes.
- *Educational Content:* This moral realist position holds certain acts (torture, genocide, slavery) are wrong universally, regardless of cultural approval or historical context. Moral facts exist independent of belief.

**Q75:** Moral truths exist and can be discovered through reason, experience, or revelation.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests ethics are knowable facts that can be found through philosophy, evidence, or spiritual insight. Right and wrong aren't invented but discovered.

**Q76:** Without grounding in universal principles, ethics becomes arbitrary and unstable.
- *Educational Content:* This argues moral relativism leads to "anything goes" chaos. If right and wrong are just opinions, there's no basis to condemn atrocities or defend justice.

**Q77:** Across all cultures and eras, certain core moral standards remain constant.
- *Educational Content:* This claims some ethical rules appear universally: prohibitions on murder, reciprocity norms, care for kin. These commonalities suggest objective moral truths transcending culture.

**Q78:** Morality is a human construction that evolves as societies develop new understandings.
- *Educational Content:* This constructivist view sees ethics as created by humans to serve social needs. As societies change, moral systems adapt; there's no eternal, fixed morality.

**Q79:** Ethical disagreements often cannot be resolved because people are starting from incompatible premises.
- *Educational Content:* This suggests moral debates are sometimes intractable because participants hold fundamentally different values or axioms. Without shared foundations, agreement becomes impossible.

**Q80:** There is no single correct moral framework; reasonable people can hold fundamentally different values.
- *Educational Content:* This pluralist view accepts multiple legitimate ethical systems. Utilitarian, deontological, virtue-based, or care-based ethics all have validity; none is uniquely correct.

## F1: Change Strategy (Gradualist ↔ Radical)

**Q81:** Sometimes dramatic, disruptive action is the only way to overcome entrenched injustice.
- *Educational Content:* This asks whether systemic wrongs require revolutionary tactics. When reform fails, are strikes, occupations, or uprisings justified to force change?

**Q82:** Protest and civil disobedience are legitimate tools when institutions fail to respond.
- *Educational Content:* This addresses whether breaking laws to demand change is morally acceptable. Civil rights sit-ins or climate blockades violate laws to pressure reform.

**Q83:** Fundamental change requires confrontation, not negotiation with those who benefit from the status quo.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether compromise with power-holders achieves real change, or whether direct confrontation is necessary to overcome resistance from beneficiaries of injustice.

**Q84:** Lasting reform comes through patient, incremental work within existing institutions.
- *Educational Content:* This gradualist view favors working through established systems: legislation, courts, elections. Slow, steady change preserves stability and builds durable support.

**Q85:** Stability and continuity are valuable even when change is desirable in principle.
- *Educational Content:* This argues that disruption carries costs—uncertainty, disorder, lost progress—that may outweigh benefits of rapid change. Preserving continuity has inherent value.

**Q86:** Revolutionary movements usually cause more suffering than the injustices they aimed to correct.
- *Educational Content:* This warns that radical upheaval often produces violence, chaos, or authoritarianism worse than original problems. Think French, Russian, or Chinese revolutions' human costs.

## F2: Institutional Trust (Trusting ↔ Skeptical)

**Q87:** Major institutions—government, media, corporations—routinely mislead the public to serve their own interests.
- *Educational Content:* This skeptical view sees powerful organizations as self-serving and deceptive. Institutions spin, hide information, or lie to protect their power and privilege.

**Q88:** Official experts often conceal important information or present biased conclusions.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether credentialed authorities (scientists, doctors, economists) provide objective truth or whether their conclusions serve institutional or ideological agendas.

**Q89:** The people who run powerful institutions are more interested in protecting their position than serving the public.
- *Educational Content:* This cynical view holds that institutional leaders prioritize self-preservation and power over public service. Bureaucrats and executives serve themselves first.

**Q90:** On balance, the institutions that run society are genuinely trying to do the right thing.
- *Educational Content:* This trusting view assumes institutional actors, despite flaws, generally pursue public good. Government, corporations, and NGOs mostly try to serve legitimate purposes.

**Q91:** Most professionals—doctors, scientists, judges—can be trusted to act with integrity.
- *Educational Content:* This holds that expertise and professional ethics ensure trustworthy conduct. While some individuals fail, most credentialed professionals are honest and competent.

**Q92:** Democratic institutions, despite their flaws, generally produce fair outcomes over time.
- *Educational Content:* This argues that democratic processes—elections, courts, legislatures—self-correct and tend toward justice even if imperfect. The system works in the long run.

## F3: Justice Style (Retributive ↔ Restorative)

**Q93:** The primary goal of justice should be repairing harm and reintegrating offenders into society.
- *Educational Content:* Restorative justice prioritizes healing and rehabilitation over punishment. It seeks to repair damage, restore relationships, and help offenders become productive members of society.

**Q94:** Bringing victims and offenders together to seek understanding produces better outcomes than punishment alone.
- *Educational Content:* This approach uses dialogue and mediation between harmed parties and wrongdoers. Face-to-face reconciliation may achieve closure and prevent reoffending better than imprisonment.

**Q95:** Most people who commit crimes need support and rehabilitation, not cages.
- *Educational Content:* This questions incarceration as the default response to crime. It suggests addressing root causes (poverty, addiction, trauma) and providing treatment produces better outcomes than punishment.

**Q96:** Wrongdoers deserve punishment proportional to the severity of their offense.
- *Educational Content:* Retributive justice holds that offenders should suffer consequences matching their crimes. Proportionate punishment is morally required, regardless of deterrence or rehabilitation.

**Q97:** A justice system that does not punish crime fails to uphold moral order.
- *Educational Content:* This argues punishment affirms societal values and vindicates victims. Without consequences, moral boundaries dissolve and justice isn't served.

**Q98:** Accountability means facing real consequences, not just dialogue and reconciliation.
- *Educational Content:* This questions whether restorative approaches provide genuine accountability. True responsibility may require suffering consequences, not merely apologizing or making amends.
