This question asks whether biodiversity and wilderness merit protection even when they provide no clear human benefit." },
  { id: 6, order: 3, axis: "C1", key: 1, text: "Prices for essential goods should be determined by supply and demand, not government regulation.", educational_content: "Market-directed economies rely on price signals to allocate resources efficiently. Advocates argue free prices prevent shortages and incentivize production, while critics contend that markets for necessities like food and housing need regulation to ensure affordability and prevent exploitation." },

Redistributionists argue concentrated inherited wealth perpetuates aristocracy, and that estate taxes promote equality of opportunity across generations." },
  { id: 41, order: 88, axis: "F2", key: -1, text: "Most professionals—doctors, scientists, judges—can be trusted to act with integrity.", educational_content: "This measures baseline trust in credentialed expertise. Trusting perspectives view professionals as largely guided by ethics and evidence despite occasional failures. Skeptics see institutional pressures, conflicts of interest, and groupthink as systematically corrupting expert judgment." },

Universalists counter that moral obligations don't diminish with distance." },
  { id: 48, order: 72, axis: "C9", key: 1, text: "Economic development should be constrained when it threatens biodiversity or ecosystem health.", educational_content: "Ecocentrists prioritize ecological preservation over economic growth when conflicts arise.

  { id: 80, order: 44, axis: "C5", key: -1, text: "There is value in preserving customs and rituals even when their original purpose has faded.", educational_content: "Traditionalists argue rituals provide meaning, continuity, and community cohesion independent of their functional origins. Progressivists counter that preserving practices whose rationale has disappeared perpetuates empty formalism or conceals oppressive origins." },
  { id: 81, order: 20, axis: "C2", key: 1, text: "Wealth inequality is a natural outcome of differences in talent, effort, and choices.", educational_content: "Property rights advocates view wealth distribution as reflecting individual merit and productivity. Redistributionists counter that outcomes depend heavily on inherited advantages, structural barriers, and luck—and that extreme inequality undermines equal opportunity and social cohesion." },
  { id: 82, order: 94, axis: "F1", key: -1, text: "Revolutionary movements usually cause more suffering than the injustices they aimed to correct.", educational_content: "Gradualists point to violent revolutions that produced authoritarian regimes or chaos. They argue incremental reform is safer and more effective. Radicals counter that gradualism fails when power structures resist change and cite successful revolutionary movements." },
  { id: 83, order: 64, axis: "C6", key: 1, text: "Moral rules should apply equally to all people regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion.", educational_content: "Universalists believe ethical principles transcend group boundaries—that human rights apply to all equally. Particularists argue different communities legitimately have different values and that universal rules often reflect cultural imperialism disguised as moral truth." },
  { id: 84, order: 55, axis: "C7", key: 1, text: "Global problems require global governance that nations cannot opt out of.", educational_content: "Strong integrationists argue that issues like climate change, pandemics, or nuclear proliferation require binding international authority with enforcement power. Sovereigntists view this as undemocratic world government and argue cooperation should remain voluntary." },
  { id: 85, order: 32, axis: "C4", key: 1, text: "Regions should be allowed to experiment with different policies rather than follow a single national model.", educational_content: "Federalism advocates view policy diversity as beneficial experimentation—different approaches reveal what works best. Centralists worry this creates unfair variation in rights and services, and that some 'experiments' harm vulnerable populations." },
  { id: 86, order: 90, axis: "C3", key: -1, text: "Schools and employers should enforce conduct codes even when they limit personal expression.", educational_content: "Order-focused perspectives prioritize institutional authority to maintain standards and protect others from offensive behavior. Civil libertarians argue conduct codes often suppress legitimate expression and that institutions overreach in regulating personal speech and behavior." },
  { id: 87, order: 69, axis: "C9", key: 1, text: "Humans have a duty to preserve wild nature even at significant cost to our own prosperity.", educational_content: "Deep ecologists argue moral obligations extend to preserving ecosystems and species even at substantial economic sacrifice. Anthropocentrists counter that while environmental protection matters, human welfare must take priority when tradeoffs are necessary." },
  { id: 88, order: 98, axis: "C10", key: 1, text: "There is no single correct moral framework; reasonable people can hold fundamentally different values.", educational_content: "Moral pluralists argue ethical disagreements often stem from incompatible foundational values rather than factual disputes, and no objective standard can resolve them. Universalists counter that this leads to moral paralysis and inability to condemn clearly evil practices." },
  { id: 89, order: 83, axis: "F1", key: 1, text: "Fundamental change requires confrontation, not negotiation with those who benefit from the status quo.", educational_content: "Radicals argue power concedes nothing without demand and that elites will compromise only when forced. Gradualists counter that confrontational approaches polarize societies, create backlash, and that building coalitions through negotiation achieves more lasting change." },
  { id: 90, order: 67, axis: "C6", key: 1, text: "Aid and assistance should be allocated based on need, not on shared identity or proximity.", educational_content: "Universalists argue resources should go where they do the most good regardless of group membership. Particularists counter that communities have special obligations to their own members and that effective aid requires the trust and accountability that come from shared bonds." },
  { id: 91, order: 4, axis: "C10", key: 1, text: "Morality is a human construction that evolves as societies develop new understandings.", educational_content: "Moral constructivists view ethics as created by humans through culture and social agreement, changing over time like language or art. Realists argue this implies no moral criticism across cultures is valid and that it confuses changing beliefs with changing truths." },
  { id: 92, order: 70, axis: "C9", key: -1, text: "The natural world exists as a resource for human use and flourishing.", educational_content: "Anthropocentric views measure nature's value instrumentally—by its usefulness to humanity. This perspective prioritizes human development and assumes environmental protection should serve human interests. Ecocentrists reject the premise that nature exists for human benefit." },
  { id: 93, order: 37, axis: "C5", key: 1, text: "Cultural norms should evolve to reflect new understandings of identity and relationships.", educational_content: "Progressivists argue social norms must adapt as knowledge advances about gender, sexuality, family structure, and identity. They view resistance as clinging to outdated categories. Traditionalists counter that constant redefinition erodes shared meaning and social stability." },
  { id: 94, order: 16, axis: "C10", key: 1, text: "Ethical disagreements often cannot be resolved because people are starting from incompatible premises.", educational_content: "Moral pluralists argue many disagreements reflect fundamentally different value systems with no common ground for resolution. Universalists counter that moral truth exists independently of disagreement and that reasoning can resolve apparent conflicts." },
  { id: 95, order: 59, axis: "C6", key: 1, text: "National borders are morally arbitrary lines that shouldn't determine who deserves our concern.", educational_content: "Cosmopolitans view nationality as an accident of birth that shouldn't affect moral obligations. Particularists argue borders reflect meaningful political communities with shared institutions and mutual obligations that legitimately create special duties to fellow citizens." },
  { id: 96, order: 2, axis: "C10", key: -1, text: "Across all cultures and eras, certain core moral standards remain constant.", educational_content: "Moral universalists believe fundamental ethical truths (like prohibitions on murder or torture) transcend cultural variation. Pluralists point to dramatic historical and cross-cultural moral differences to argue no unchanging core exists." },
  { id: 97, order: 60, axis: "C6", key: -1, text: "Strong group identity and mutual obligation within communities produce better outcomes than abstract universalism.", educational_content: "Communitarians argue that thick local ties create trust, accountability, and effective cooperation that abstract universal principles cannot match. Universalists counter that in-group favoritism perpetuates tribalism and that moral obligations shouldn't depend on group membership." },

Even beneficial changes should proceed carefully. Radicals counter that valuing stability privileges existing power structures and delays necessary reforms." }
